### User Personas

Joe Yodel is hosting a little get-together with his music buddies.  Typically, he either prints out or takes pictures of the sheet music and sends them to everyone to look at on their mobile devices.  With Staple, he can upload the files, sheet music, lyrics, audio files ahead of time, format them and send everyone links.    

Bianca Bosslady has a presentation and wants her staff to be able to be able to refer to the supplementary reading materials during the presentation.  With Staple, she can quickly share the link to everyone and not have to worry about anyone needing to download anything on their devices to navigate her content.
