# BEW 1.2 Contractor Project Proposal

Staple is basically intended to replace any sort of paper packets with a digital document organizer/viewer.  It's useful because it saves paper and attempts to be an easy to use, middle ground between google drive and preview.  The intention is to support and display a variety of file formats as well as edit in-browser text and organize it in an easy to access, view and navigate on various electronic screens (computer, phone, tablet).

I aim to learn how to use databases efficiently and integrate pre-existing open sources apps.
